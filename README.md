## Essay: How Text Classification could help with the UN's SDGs

The text classification component of this project, which uses natural language processing to classify movie genres based on their summaries and titles, has promising potential for supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through its analytical capabilities, this system can be applied in educational settings to help students and teachers identify relevant films aligned with curricular goals, thereby promoting quality education (SDG 4). Furthermore, it can play a pivotal role in advocating for gender equality (SDG 5) by assessing the representation of genders in media, highlighting films with balanced and inclusive portrayals.

Additionally, this classification approach could serve to reduce inequalities (SDG 10) by identifying and encouraging diverse storytelling, ensuring cultural and ethnic groups receive equitable representation in global media. The projectâ€™s capacity for analyzing the evolution of cultural themes through movies also supports the preservation of heritage and community identity, directly aligning with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Lastly, by leveraging genre and thematic analysis, this technology could help strengthen public institutions (SDG 16) by identifying films addressing critical social issues, contributing to a culture of peace, justice, and reliable information dissemination.

Overall, applying intelligent text classification to media analysis not only enhances our understanding of film content but also positions entertainment as a proactive partner in achieving sustainable global development.
